# Premise
If you're writing a library and you want it to give its users language support, you'll need to provide your users with a way for telling your library how they operate languages in their app.

The language integration module is a shared space for libraries to consume their user's language services.
It sits between the user's app and imported libraries to centralize and standardize the communication with the app's language services.
