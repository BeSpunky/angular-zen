# UrlLocalizationService
This service reflects on the currently navigated url and gives you the ability to easily localize and delocalize it.
For this service to work, you must provide a localization strategy when calling `LanguageIntegrationModule.forRoot()` using the optional `urlLocalization` property.

## Strategies
A localization strategy tells the localization service where and how the current language is expressed in the url.
The strategy is then transformed into a localizer class which holds the implementation.

There are 3 built-in localizers:

| Localizer                   | Instantiated when strategy is... | Implementation                                                                         |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RoutePositionUrlLocalizer` | a `number`              | The language is a segment in the route. The strategy is the position within the route. |
| `QueryParamsUrlLocalizer`   | a `string`              | The language is a query param. The strategy is the param name.                         |
| `NoopUrlLocalizer`          | not provided            | Always returns an unchanged url.                                                       |

You can also set a factory or class provider to implement your own localization strategy.
An example use case would be localization using sub-domains or host replacement for different languages.

See the [`LanguageIntegrationProvider.urlLocalization`](LINK TO CODE) property for complete API and documentation.

# LocalizedRouteAwareService (abstract)
Acting as a base class for services, facilitates boostrapping for services requiring both route-awareness and language-awareness.

Extend this service and override the `onLanguageChanged()` method to get notified when the integrated app changes its current language:
```typescript
import { Injectable                 } from '@angular/core';
import { LocalizedRouteAwareService } from '@bespunky/angular-zen/language';

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
class LocalizedRouteAwareMock extends LocalizedRouteAwareService
{
    // Bonus: No constructor. Defaults to base constructor.

    protected onLanguageChanged(lang: string) 
    {
        // Act on language change... (use `this.language` for language tools)
    }
}
```

> Consider marking `onLanguageChanged()` as protected, as it is usually intended for internal class use.

## Route-aware and destroyable
A `LocalizedRouteAwareService` is by definiton a [`RouteAwareService`](/Modules/RouterXModule/RouteAwareService-\(abstract\)), which is also [`Destroyable`](/Modules/CoreModule/Destroyable-\(abstract\)).
Take advantage of the tools provided by the base class.
