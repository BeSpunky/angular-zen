[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/BeSpunky/BeSpunky%20Libraries/_apis/build/status/Build%20and%20test%20angular-zen)](https://dev.azure.com/BeSpunky/BeSpunky%20Libraries/_build/latest?definitionId=27)

This angular **workspace** provides:
- The `angular-zen` library containing a set of general purpose modules and tools written by our team at BeSpunky
- A `demo` app with examples.

> When published to npm, only the library itself is published.

### Examples
For working examples, visit the code for the [demo app](https://dev.azure.com/BeSpunky/BeSpunky%20Libraries/_git/angular-zen?path=%2Fprojects%2Fdemo&version=GBmaster&_a=contents).

Each module in the library has its dedicated folder in the demo app.

# Documentation

All modules / components / services are documented within the code. Some might have their own `Readme.md` file accessible at their folder.

### The complete documentation is found in the [wiki](/wiki/Wiki-Home.md), and is also accessible only at [Angular-Zen Wiki](https://dev.azure.com/BeSpunky/BeSpunky%20Libraries/_wiki/wikis/angular-zen?wikiVersion=GBmaster&pageId=80&pagePath=%2FWiki%20Home).
