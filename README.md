# angular-zen workspace

This angular workspace provides a library with a set of general purpose modules and tools written by our team at BeSpunky, along with a `demo` app with examples.

# Documentation

All modules / components / services are documented within the code. Some might have their own `Readme.md` file accessible at their folder.

### The complete documentation is found in the [wiki](/wiki/readme), and is also accessible only at [angular-zen wiki](TODO).

# Angular CLI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
